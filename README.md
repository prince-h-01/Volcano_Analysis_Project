# Volcano_Analysis_Project
This project focuses on the analysis of volcanic eruptions, their frequency, intensity, and 
impact. Volcanoes are natural phenomena that have significant effects on the environment 
and human life. In this project, we analyzed global volcanic activity using data from various 
sources, focusing on eruption statistics, the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), and other 
relevant information.

The findings from this project provide valuable insights into global volcanic activity. By 
understanding the frequency and intensity of eruptions, we can better assess the potential 
risks posed by volcanoes. Additionally, knowing which volcanoes are the highest and their 
types helps in understanding their geological significance and potential hazards. The 
distribution of VEI levels highlights the range of volcanic activity, emphasizing the 
importance of monitoring volcanoes for both low and high-level eruptions
